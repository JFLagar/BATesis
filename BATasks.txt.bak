Character Select
BUGS:

MAJOR AI: It can jump down the stage (Disabling crouch)
Saw momentary: Jump and attack cause position override (can't reproduce)
MAJOR jumping towards enemy on the corner makes corner switch > attacking then pushes player outside corner (Cant Reproduce)

Bug: Sometimes opponent can't get bellow jumping and steal corner. > Pushbox rework

Bug: Controller Mapping Bugs

Fixed:
Attacks: Attacks don't wait for the previous one to finish to be done (overwrites value) FIXED
Blocking Detection overrides damage > Fixed
Launchers go back to standing > has to do with ground detection
Fix jumping or ground detection for same height everytime -> Fixed
Animation Knockdown doesnt consider hitstun -> Fixed
Backwards Jump doesnt respect cameraWall/Wall >> FIXED
Character on wall can swap places with other character (has to push) > FIXED
Damage/Block: polish prevent state from changing - repeat animation with several hits recovery hits not working properly >
-> Can't Block after being knockeddown -> FIXED
Can jump backwards outside camera. > Fixed
Light canceling into self don't cancel the animation. -> Fixed
Close to wall doesn't get push back (if both characters are walled) -> Fixed
Character can't change state (Standing Crouching Jumping) for combos. -> Fixed
MAJOR: Sometimes Recovery doesn't trigger (Fixed with work around)
Jumping and getting attacked  can cause that the player is considered standing - Fixed
BUILD Combos are not doable or not displayed; (The first hit gets insta deleted) FIXED
Can block when whiffing attacks -> Not apparent on build > Fixed
Repeated Cancel bugs not allowing for more than 2 cancels > Fixed
Bugs: OTG (in recovery) > FIxed
Bugs: Light cancelling ignoring limit > FIXED
Bug: Block Recovery can get hit > FIXED
Bug:Can't Jump forward from screenedge > Fixed
Bug: Jump and Attack at the same time sometimes. (Animation) > these two issues can be solve with a better input system
Bug: Comboing from jump to ground makes ground hit hit twice > Recognizes 5L as jL > Fixed
Bug: Jumping recognizes as exiting and entering instead of happening once. > Fixed

Goal:
#Implement Feedback:
5H should be kick (more range)
jL hitbox is too broken (hitbox is too low)
jumping arc should be more curve (more floaty / gravity)
Add round end
#Add Features:

Feedback v0.1:
Jump not working in somemachines -> Create Jump Recovery (can do any action but not movement) -work awating new feedback-
Camera Zoom is too big - fixed
Stage is too big - fixed
Jump Floating- fixed
Frame counter (not need)
[Can't Move when blocking 
add blockstun/hitstun 
Add Block range] Block Stun - fixed

BUG: Jumping and getting attacked  can cause that the player is considered standing > Fixed
Sometimes Damage get done even when blocked > Fixed
jL hitbox is too broken (hitbox is too low)

Choose between input or button special
NVidia framecap > Done
