Special Attacks

BUGS:

Close to wall doesn't get push back (if both characters are walled)
Character can't change state (Standing Crouching Jumping) for combos. -> Fixed
Jump and Attack at the same time sometimes bug.


Fixed:
Attacks: Attacks don't wait for the previous one to finish to be done (overwrites value) FIXED
Blocking Detection overrides damage > Fixed
Launchers go back to standing > has to do with ground detection
Fix jumping or ground detection for same height everytime -> Fixed
Animation Knockdown doesnt consider hitstun -> Fixed
Backwards Jump doesnt respect cameraWall/Wall >> FIXED
Character on wall can swap places with other character (has to push) > FIXED
Damage/Block: polish prevent state from changing - repeat animation with several hits recovery hits not working properly >
-> Can't Block after being knockeddown -> FIXED


Goal:
Combos and combo display
