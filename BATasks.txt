Saw momentary: Jump and attack cause position override (can't reproduce)

Bug: Jumping is bug with new input system (Jump fall) ONLY BUGS When P2 Is disabled X
Bug: Input mapping dont carry over from scene to scene > OBsolete

Bug: Projectile Hitbox not working as intended




Fixed:
Attacks: Attacks don't wait for the previous one to finish to be done (overwrites value) FIXED
Blocking Detection overrides damage > Fixed
Launchers go back to standing > has to do with ground detection
Fix jumping or ground detection for same height everytime -> Fixed
Animation Knockdown doesnt consider hitstun -> Fixed
Backwards Jump doesnt respect cameraWall/Wall >> FIXED
Character on wall can swap places with other character (has to push) > FIXED
Damage/Block: polish prevent state from changing - repeat animation with several hits recovery hits not working properly >
-> Can't Block after being knockeddown -> FIXED
Can jump backwards outside camera. > Fixed
Light canceling into self don't cancel the animation. -> Fixed
Close to wall doesn't get push back (if both characters are walled) -> Fixed
Character can't change state (Standing Crouching Jumping) for combos. -> Fixed
MAJOR: Sometimes Recovery doesn't trigger (Fixed with work around)
Jumping and getting attacked  can cause that the player is considered standing - Fixed
BUILD Combos are not doable or not displayed; (The first hit gets insta deleted) FIXED
Can block when whiffing attacks -> Not apparent on build > Fixed
Repeated Cancel bugs not allowing for more than 2 cancels > Fixed
Bugs: OTG (in recovery) > FIxed
Bugs: Light cancelling ignoring limit > FIXED
Bug: Block Recovery can get hit > FIXED
Bug:Can't Jump forward from screenedge > Fixed
Bug: Jump and Attack at the same time sometimes. (Animation) > these two issues can be solve with a better input system
Bug: Comboing from jump to ground makes ground hit hit twice > Recognizes 5L as jL > Fixed
Bug: Jumping recognizes as exiting and entering instead of happening once. > Fixed
Bug: jH>5H causes combo bug - Fixed
Bug: Vector2 Values are wrong when simulpress > Fixed
Bug: 6S bugs after 2H (maybe pushbloc) > Fixed
Bug: Round start sometimes bugs - FIXED
Bug: 6S on corner pushes character down - Fixed
Bug: P2 side CORNER is bugged and can cause fall into the screen after attacking(and jumping) > Fixed
	>Rework ground detection > FIxed
	>jumping towards enemy on the corner makes corner switch > Fixed
	attacking then pushes player outside corner (Cant Reproduce) > Fixed
	> Sometimes opponent can't get bellow jumping and steal corner. FIXED
		> Pushbox rework (when applying gravity) FIXED
